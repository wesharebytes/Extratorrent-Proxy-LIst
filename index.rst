# Can't access Extratorrent.cc? Here is a list of Proxy sites and Extratorrent mirrors

ISP blocks or territorial restrictions often affect your ability to access the torrent index, and this is where the Extratorrent proxy comes in. The proxy site redirects your Internet requests through another server to the site you want to access, acting as an intermediary so that it does not appear to be trying to access a blocked IP address.
Mirror sites work in a similar way, placing a copy of the site's original torrent index on another website, the access to which, apparently, has not yet been blocked. Both of these methods are great for unlocking access, so you can still enjoy Extratorrent shows and other types of content.
